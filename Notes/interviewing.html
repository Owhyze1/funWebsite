  <h3>What Are Three Things That You Want This Person to Know About You</h3>
  <p>Craft your story and/or responses to their questions around those 3 things. If you are very clear about what your top 3 points are, then it will be very easy for them to say that this person has these 3 qualities. Then everyone else that you spoke with will be on the same page about these same 3 qualities.</p>
